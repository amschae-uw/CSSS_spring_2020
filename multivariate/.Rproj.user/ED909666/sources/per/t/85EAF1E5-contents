## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(robustHD)

data <- as.data.frame(matrix(1:1, nrow = 5, ncol = 0))
data$height <- c(68, 73, 67, 64, 76)
data$weight <- c(140, 185, 165, 120, 210)
data$shoesize <- c(9.5, 12, 11, 10, 12)

data$height<- standardize(data$height)
data$weight<- standardize(data$weight)
data$shoesize<- standardize(data$shoesize)

head(data)

 ((.70+.54)^2+(.59-.03)^2+(.96-.09)^2)^.5

library(philentropy)

# compute the Euclidean Distance with default parameters
distance(data, method = "euclidean", use.row.names = TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
